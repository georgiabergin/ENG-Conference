			ENG stands for “electronic news gathering.” It’s a type of news story in which reporters shoot on location and editors use the electronic video and audio in order to “gather” and present news. ENGs have been the status quo in news rooms for years. News rooms have been the status quo for years. However, everything is changing in this Internet age. How we relayed information yesterday is not the same as how we do today. How we will tell the news tomorrow is anybody’s guess.</p>

		<p>	ENG 2018, a conference located in Washington D.C.’s Newseum, plans to bring a whole new meaning to the classic acronym. The conference will be exactly what it sounds like: a gathering of professionals concerned with the future of electronic news. It will feature speakers from all across the communication field, including editors, documentary producers, journalists, writers, creative directors, and so on. Lectures and workshops will be given on subject such as how to create a viral video, the importance of Twitter, the state of online newspapers, and more. ENG 2018 will be a full day of learning, hypothesizing, and creating the future of news. </p>
